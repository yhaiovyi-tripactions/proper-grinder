//! Embassy Async Button Handler
//!
//! This module provides a production-ready, async button handler specifically
//! designed for Embassy async/await applications. It uses Embassy's EXTI (External Interrupt)
//! support for efficient async GPIO operations.
//!
//! # Key Features
//! 
//! - **üö´ Zero Polling** - Pure async/await architecture with Embassy's EXTI support
//! - **‚ö° Embassy Native** - Designed for Embassy's async executor and task patterns
//! - **üîÑ Software Debouncing** - Eliminates mechanical switch bounce with Embassy Timer
//! - **üéØ Event-Driven** - Uses Embassy Channels for clean async communication
//! - **üß© Hardware Agnostic** - Works with any Embassy-compatible GPIO pin
//! - **‚öôÔ∏è Dual Configuration** - Supports both active-high and active-low button configurations
//!
//! # Embassy Integration Pattern
//!
//! This module follows Embassy's async pattern:
//! 1. **Button Task** ‚Üí waits for pin edges with `wait_for_any_edge()` ‚Üí sends to channel
//! 2. **Debounce Logic** ‚Üí uses `Timer::after()` for delay ‚Üí validates state
//! 3. **Event Processing** ‚Üí receives from channel ‚Üí processes button events
//!
//! # Usage Example
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use embassy_sync::channel::Channel;
//! use embassy_sync::blocking_mutex::raw::NoopRawMutex;
//! use button::{ButtonEvent, ButtonAction, button_task, handle_button_event};
//!
//! // Create a channel for button events
//! static BUTTON_CHANNEL: Channel<NoopRawMutex, ButtonEvent, 4> = Channel::new();
//!
//! #[embassy_executor::main]
//! async fn main(spawner: Spawner) {
//!     let p = embassy_stm32::init(Default::default());
//!     let button = Input::new(p.PB2, Pull::Up);
//!     let button_exti = ExtiInput::new(button, p.EXTI2);
//!     
//!     // Spawn button task
//!     spawner.spawn(button_task(button_exti, BUTTON_CHANNEL.sender())).unwrap();
//!     
//!     // Handle button events
//!     loop {
//!         let event = BUTTON_CHANNEL.receive().await;
//!         let action = handle_button_event(event);
//!         // Process action...
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

/// * `button_exti` - Embassy ExtiInput configured for the button

/// * `config` - Button configuration (debounce timing, active level)
/// 
/// # Async Behavior
/// 
/// This task:
/// 1. Waits for GPIO edge interrupts using `wait_for_any_edge()`
/// 2. Performs software debouncing with `Timer::after()`
/// 3. Validates stable state transitions
/// 4. Sends confirmed events via Embassy channel
